# A simple app for downloading photos from Instagram
- This an app developed with a library of instaloader where I had to apply my knowledge that I learned from some videos 
about Python for beginners:
    - Like: Modules, functions, loops, conditional, inputs, variables
    - Yeah, I know is basic, but I'll improve my programming skills.

## How to run this project?
1. If you don't have python on your PC, You'll download from python official website 
2. Then you can open VStudioCode or Pycharm and the git clone the repository from GitHub
3. You only need to run the main.py file
4. For example: python main.py on VSC, but if you open Pycharm you only have to click on the green triangle
5. When the program is running it will show you a menu from CLI and you only need to follow the instructions.
6. Finally, you'll get all the photos from that account that you wanted.


- PD: There are some mistakes, but I'm still learning.
- PD2: instaloader is a library, I got some functions to develop this.
